* Installation

The following instructions have been tested to work on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine.

1. Clone this repository and head to the root directory.

2. Install PyTorch and pybind11 as build-time dependencies. This is necessary
   to build the CUDA superpixel pooling extension and the K-shortest paths
   C++ extension, respectively.
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    pip install "torch>=1.8" "pybind11>=2.6"
    #+END_SRC

3. Install the package. This will install the required run-time dependencies.
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    pip install .
    #+END_SRC

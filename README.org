#+TITLE: Self-supervised Non-Negative PU Learning + KSPTrack

This repository contains the code related to the
method SSnnPU+KSPTrack from paper /A Positive/Unlabeled Approach for the Segmentation of Medical Sequences using Point-Wise Supervision/.

* Installation

The following instructions have been tested to work on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine.

1. Clone this repository and head to the root directory.

2. Install PyTorch and pybind11 as a build-time dependencies. This is necessary
   to build the CUDA superpixel pooling extension and the K-shortest paths
   C++ extension, respectively.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install "torch>=1.8" "pybind11>=2.6"
    #+END_SRC

3. Install the package. This will install the required run-time dependencies.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pip install .
    #+END_SRC

KSPTrack is a method for the segmentation of video and volumetric sequences
with sparse point supervision.
